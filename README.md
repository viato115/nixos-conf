# This is my NixOS and Home-Manager config repo, it is still WIP.

System: Lenovo ThinkPad L13 Yoga Gen2 (2-in-1 convertible Laptop) on NixOS unstable with standalone Home-Manager and Hyprland.

**TODO**:
- Convert my current Neovim Config to Flakes
- Build iio-hyprland the nix way (currently problem 1)
- Configure Mako/Dunst, EWW and Wofi/Rofi
- Add ad blocking network module

## I currently have a major problem
